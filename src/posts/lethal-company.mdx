Lethal Company, developed only by a single developer known as Zeekers, unexpectedly received a very popular review among the players despite it being released on 23rd October 2023 and it’s in the early access stage. Creating the game single-handedly, Zeekers succeeded in making the game extremely popular and become one of the major hype in the gaming industry.

As most games were pursuing a high-tech end and big storage, Zeekers made a game small and affordable enough to be popular. Despite being horror, the fun of the game also adds to its value, bringing more players to play.

How did Lethal Company gain Its popularity?

### No Complicated Specifications

Unlike most games, where the specifications continue to rise throughout the years. Lethal Company has few and simple specifications.

The minimum specification to play the game requires:

- Intel i5–7400 @3.00 GHz; Shader Model 5
- A storage of 1GB
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050
- Internet Broadband
- Windows 10 OS

As the Intel i5–7400 release date is early January 2017, and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 is in the autumn of 2016, the specification alone piques the players’ curiosity. With a simple specification, there’s no doubt that Lethal Company immediately gains players’ interest due to more affordable resources to operate this game.

Most games these days require an exorbitant amount of specification and storage, such as more than 100GB of storage, a high-end graphics drive, or even processors that most players can’t afford.

### Reasonable Price

With the price of US$ 9,99 on Steam, it’s already reasonable enough to play. Unlike recent games, where most games can be priced above US$ 29,99, Lethal Company immediately takes a big hit of popularity to the players who wish to enjoy the new game.

Even though most games have a fan base, with a high price alone, it’ll be difficult to afford it. In addition, with some seasonal events that can cost more money, the developer of such a game may find it difficult to maintain it in the future.

### Co-Op Friendly

Lethal Company could be no fun if playing alone, as its main purpose is to play with other players. The more players play the game, the more fun it will be. Playing solo has the biggest risk, with the addition that the players who seek to challenge themselves alone may be suitable for this.

Playing solo means we must plan everything, such as coming back before the dark, avoiding contact as much as possible, and even making an alternate plan should things worsen. Some entities were designed to chase us indefinitely, and playing solo would raise the risk to a higher level.

On the other hand, playing co-op can boost our chances of survival and the game’s fun. Since the game allows modding to add players for more than four players (As Standard co-op gameplay in the game), it always brings a lot more fun than playing alone.

Even though the same is set for horror due to the entities we encounter, the horror game itself can be fun when played together. Through the fun of playing co-op, the game immediately goes from unknown to a big success, which the developer, Zeekers, is unaware of at the start.

With no complicated specifications, reasonable price, and the fun of playing the game together, combining all of those three, Zeekers manages to bring Lethal Company into a big success. What Zeekers have to do next is to maintain the hype and provide the fans with constant updates about the game.
