  title: Artificial Intelligence Definition
  intro: Artificial intelligence has many definitions and for people who are just beginning in this world of artificial intelligence, it is confusing for them to get a clear definition of artificial intelligence (AI). Most people at the beginning look for the definition of artificial intelligence in Wikipedia but it does not explain what artificial intelligence (AI) really is. For that reason, in this article I will try to expose all the definitions that exist on artificial intelligence and I will help you to find the clearest and most precise one.

## Definitions of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

1. According to **Margaret Rouse**:

> “Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.”

2. According to **B.J. Copeland (Brittanica)**:

> “Definition of Artificial intelligence (AI): the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.”

3. According to **Techopedia**:

> “Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans.”

4. According to Daniel Fagella:

> “Artificial intelligence is an entity (or collective set of cooperative entities), able to receive inputs from the environment, interpret and learn from such inputs, and exhibit related and flexible behaviors and actions that help the entity achieve a particular goal or objective over a period of time.”

5. According to John McCarthy (Stanford University):

> “Artificial Intelligence definition: It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.”

6. According to Matt Mahoney (Quora):

> “The ability of a machine communicating using natural language over a teletype to fool a person into believing it was a human. “AGI” or “artificial general intelligence” extends this idea to require machines to do everything that humans can do, such as understand images, navigate a robot, recognize and respond appropriately to facial expressions, distinguish music genres, and so on.”

7. According to Nanalyze:

> “Artificial intelligence (AI) is a computerized system that exhibits behavior that is commonly thought of as requiring intelligence.”

8. According to Oreilly:

> “Defining artificial intelligence isn’t just difficult; it’s impossible, not the least because we don’t really understand human intelligence. Paradoxically, advances in AI will help more to define what human intelligence isn’t than what artificial intelligence is.”

9. According to Doctor Ashok Goel (Georgia Institute of Technology):

> “Definition of Artificial Intelligence: is the science of building artificial minds by understanding how natural minds work and understanding how natural minds work by building artificial minds.”

10. According to Sciencedaily:

> “The modern definition of artificial intelligence (or AI) is “the study and design of intelligent agents” where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximizes its chances of success.”

There are many definitions of artificial intelligence, I hope these definitions help you understand the meaning of artificial intelligence (AI). See you in the next article about the wonderful world of **artificial intelligence**.
